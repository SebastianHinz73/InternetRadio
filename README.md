# Internet Radio

With this repository, Espressif's LyraT board becomes an Internet radio.  
   
   
The Install directory contains the installation script with the finished binaries to flash the board. The sources are located in the LyratRadio directory.  
   
The binary has two preset Internet channels saved. There is an Android app (todo publish app) to find Internet stations and use them to configure the Lyrat radio.
