With this repository, Espressif's LyraT board becomes an Internet radio.  
   
Flashing is started with the command flash.cmd. A menu appears in which the Com Port can be set. 
The connection to the Lyrat board can be tested with a menu item. Flashing is started via another menu item.   
   
When the message 'Connecting.....__' appears, the board must be put into boot mode. This is done by pressing and releasing the reset button while holding the boot button.
